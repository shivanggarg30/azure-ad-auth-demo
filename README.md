This project uses React with Vite for the frontend and Node.js with Express for the backend. 
It integrates Azure Active Directory OAuth 2.0 for user authentication.
The backend handles the auth flow and exchanges the code for tokens using Microsoft Graph API. 
Upon successful login, user data is base64-encoded and passed to the frontend.
